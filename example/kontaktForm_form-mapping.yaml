# PDF Mapping Configuration for TYPO3 Form Extension
#
# This file defines the mapping between form field identifiers and their
# corresponding positions within a PDF file. It is used by a custom TYPO3
# extension to render submitted form data into predefined PDF templates.
#
# üìÅ File location (required): fileadmin/form_definitions/
# The configuration file must be placed in this directory.
#
# üìÑ File naming convention (important for multiple forms):
# You can create different configurations for multiple forms by using the
# following filename structure:
#
#     <form-label>_form-mapping.yaml
#
# Example:
#     contact_form_form-mapping.yaml
#     job_application_form-mapping.yaml
#
# Here, <form-label> refers to the "Label" of the form
# as defined in your TYPO3 form setup. The system will automatically select
# the correct mapping file based on the submitted form.
#
# üîß Structure:
# Each top-level key refers to a PDF page number (1-based).
# Under each page, define a list of form fields and their rendering properties.
#
# Properties per field:
# - field:       The identifier of the form field 
# - x, y:        Position (in mm or PDF units) on the page
# - fontSize:    Size of the text in the PDF
# - font:        Font to use (e.g., Arial, Helvetica(default))
